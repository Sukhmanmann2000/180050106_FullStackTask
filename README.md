# 180050106_FullStackTask
This is a web app for uploading and displaying .json file.
After cloning the repo using 'git clone https://github.com/Sukhmanmann2000/180050106_FullStackTask.git', go into the cloned directory and run 'python3 flask_app.py' (if you have Windows OS with only python3 installed, use 'python flask_app.py'). This will run the server on your machine. Now go to your browser and enter 'http://localhost:5000/'. Now you can sign up using your email-id and get the verification code on the entered email. Then login and use the web app. Have fun!!!

The given .json file should be a list of dictionaries, all dictionaries having the same keys. Make sure you have and active internet connection before trying to use the web app.

# Requirements
Mainly you have to install flask using 'pip install flask' and flask-sqlalchemy 'pip install flask-sqlalchemy' (or use pip3). But the requirements.txt file contains all the modules installed on my machine, so you can use that too.
